## MAKE CHANGES

#### Make changes in the UI
You are welcome to edit .md files in the web UI and create a pull request for review. 

#### Make changes locally
1.	Fork the repository so that you can make changes without affecting the original project before you are ready to merge them.
2.	Create a working branch and start with your changes!

## COMMIT YOUR UPDATE
Commit the changes once you are happy with them and have proof-read them. 

#### Pull request
When you’re ready, create a pull request (PR):
-	Link to the issue if you are solving one
-	Make sure you enable “maintainer edits” so the branch can be updated for merge. We will review and potentially edit your proposal before a merge.

-	As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
